# Movie-recommendation-engine
Based on 20M ratings on IMDB movie dataset
Recommender systems are an important technology for TV/movie streaming services like Netflix,
HBO, audio/music streaming sites like Spotify, Pandora, news article feeds like Pulse, online retailers such as Amazon, Walmart etc. Indeed, any service provider or content management system that
has large quantities of information (or the ability to extract such information) such as usage patterns,
browsing and click history, natural text descriptions etc can and should make use of recommendation
methods to help find items of interest. Among various information sources, data in the form of natural text is a particularly rich and expressive source of information, however it is highly unstructured
in general. Topic models are used to extract latent structures from large volumes of unlabeled text,
that can be used for analysis of content and in turn, aid end goals such as making recommendations.
In particular, textual information such as movie plot summaries can be very helpful to improve the
prediction performance of traditional collaborative filtering. In the remaining part of this report, we
limit ourselves to the study of how topic modeling of large text corpora can help in the task of movie
recommendation, however most of the discussion/analysis can be applied to other domains.
